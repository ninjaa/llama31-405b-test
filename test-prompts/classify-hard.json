    "prompt": "Classify the following text as positive, negative, or neutral: My new job is a complex mix of emotions and experiences. The work environment is intense, with high expectations and tight deadlines. I love it! My colleagues are competitive, which pushes me to excel but also creates tension. I hate that! I'm constantly challenged, learning rapidly but often feeling overwhelmed. My boss has a hands-off approach, providing autonomy but little guidance. The company culture emphasizes results over work-life balance, leading to long hours. Some days I'm invigorated by the fast pace. Others I question if I've made the right choice. The projects are cutting-edge and impactful, yet stress can be overwhelming. I'm developing valuable skills and making important connections, but at the cost of personal time and sometimes mental well-being. This job has transformed my life, though whether it's for better or worse remains unclear. I'm torn between gratitude for the opportunity and concern about long-term sustainability.",
