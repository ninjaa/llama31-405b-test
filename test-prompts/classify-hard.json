    "prompt": "Classify the following text as positive, negative, or neutral. Single word response only: My new job is a complex mix of emotions and experiences. The work environment is intense, with high expectations and tight deadlines. I love it! My colleagues are competitive, which pushes me to excel but also creates tension. I hate that! I'm constantly challenged, learning rapidly but often feeling overwhelmed. My boss has a hands-off approach, providing autonomy but little guidance. The company culture emphasizes results over work-life balance, leading to long hours. Some days I'm invigorated by the fast pace. I'm developing valuable skills and making important connections, but at the cost of time and mental well-being. I'm torn between gratitude for the opportunity and concern about long-term sustainability.",
